# Soviet-Era and Eastern European Sci-Fi

On The Silver Globe (1988)
http://exmilitai.re/film.html
Andrzej Żuławski

Wandering cosmonauts, lunar escape, and the return voyage. The serialized attempts to colonize the moon are recounted through a dysfunctional narrative, riddled with angels of god and man. Repeated, unexpected crash-landings on the moon breed a new civilization wrought in images of their past: the victory over the moon reinstalls humanity's exports - religion, violence, war. It is hard to be a god: intergenerational trauma spirals downwards, and each iteration of lunar-humanity is further militant, degenerate and human - a domestic alienness (or: indigenous occupants). Speculative origin stories approach the zero point of falling stars. As memories are relayed back to the other present, Earth’s inter-dimensional interference traces back a desire to prevent the future: a few more cosmonauts arrive to the scene only to capitulate further to the co-emergent animality on the ground. Cross-pollination breeds both civil war and new “life,” old messiahs and tangential Earths in the ‘ideal’ image of the one prior.

O-bi, O-ba, The End of Civilization (1985)
http://exmilitai.re/film.html
Piotr Szulkin

Humanity waits in a fallout shelter washed in blue fluorescence and a self-deceptive promise that help is on the way. The aftermath of a nuclear catastrophe prior encloses this damp civilization with starvation, delirium - and most delinquent - complicity: Our ‘persuasion specialist’ navigates this subterranean drama only to find his earlier state-funded conspiracies in decline, internally rotting, as future-leadened scenario planning becomes exposed through time as vacuous in meaning. The “Ark” is not merely a half-truth in remission, but a property of the lethargy inhabiting these crowded quarters, contagious, generated from the parameters of degeneration... The escape from the outside (a looming radioactive ice field) is deluded with both biblical references and secular idols. The habitation is cold, carnivorous with apparent cracks in the ceiling. Eschatology not only points to the end times, but its negligent arrival - deterred for another time.

Letters from a Dead Man (1986)
http://exmilitai.re/film.html
Konstantin Lopushanskiy

A future breathing through gas masks, thrashing sandstorms and communicating to nothing: all the contingent results of a nuclear catastrophe (Chernobyl). A nobel prize physicist dwells in a fallout shelter, oftentimes writing to a dead son while other times sitting around a table of expiring humanists, contemplating the vacant present that once was. The radioactive outside is slowly intruding inwards - the wasteland grows - as the looming threat of an uninhabitable planet is empirically becoming true. Nihilism settles in, locates a host within humanity, and hardwires a waning civilization which contemplates all of history as one prolonged suicide. The extinction of the species will be marked by migraines followed by amnesia, resultant symptoms of the end of humanity, but also by a singularly accidental twilight - genetic and or bacterial - groundless by design.

-----------

Stalker (1979)
http://exmilitai.re/film.html
Andrej Tarkovsky

Sepia-toned reality, industrial landscapes, rust-covered train tracks, residues of scorched-earth. In the near future, adjacent a nuclear facility, a surreal expedition to “the zone” manifests fantasies and psychoses alike. Out of vocational desperation, three strangers accompany the stalker - a cartographer of liminal spaces - through military encampment, shattered colonnades and derelict warehouses to the zone. Questionable meteorites and suspicious relics color an otherworldly climate, imposed upon a naturally technicolored environment. The quietest place in the world awaits human intrusion; each visitation session is each their own clinic, where one’s innermost wish (the truth of fantasy) comes true. A few frictionless mystical states of self-annihilation later, geography opens up, a conversation takes place, and then the world resumes - rotating at an orbit not unlike ours, imprisoned at an inert pace.

More than 2,500 artists, musicians, performers and writers gathered in Dakar that month. The event spanned literature, theatre, music, dance, film, as well as the visual arts.  This is the documentary film of the event of the same name, directed by William Greaves.

Senegalese maverick filmmaker Djibril Diop Mambéty is still regarded as one of the most important African filmmakers of all time: a visionary both politically and creatively. But as a lone dissenter, allergic to institutional obedience, his work was deliberately ‘lost’ by those in power. Rarely seen yet often talked about, the film, like its creator, has been an enigma. The plot of Badou Boy (1970) looks at a “badou boy”, or a bad boy, who survives in the bustling city of Dakar in the late 1960s, a turbulent time. Part parody, part fable, the film borrows from the strategic and economic resources of the gangster genre and psychedelic punk aesthetics in order to comment on the postcolonial experience in a newly independent nation.

Moi Un Noir (1957)	
https://vimeo.com/294911765
Jean Rouch

"I, a Negro" depicts young Nigerien immigrants who left their country to find work in the Ivory Coast, in the Treichville quarter of Abidjan, the capital. These immigrants live in squalor in Treichville, envious of the bordering quarters of The Plateau (the business and industrial district) and the old African quarter of Adjame. The film traces a week in these immigrants' lives, blurring the line between their characters' routines and their own. Every morning, Tarzan, Eddy Constantine and Edward G. Robinson seek work in Treichville in hopes of getting the 20 francs that a bowl of soup costs them. They perform menial jobs as dockers carrying sacks and handy labor shipping supplies to Europe. At night, they drink away their sorrows in bars while dreaming about their idealized lives as their "movie" alter-egos, alternatively as an FBI Agent, a womanizing bachelor, a successful boxer, and even able to stand up to the white colonialists that seduce away their women. These dream-like sequences are shot in a poetic mode. Each day is introduced by an interstitial voice of god omniscient narration from Jean Rouch, providing a universal thematic distance to the movie's events. The film is book-ended by a narration directed at both Petit Jules and the audience from Edward G. Robinson fondly looking back on his childhood in Niger and concluding that his life is worthy of his dreams.

The story of tempestuous Carmen, first told in a short story by Prosper Merimee and made famous in an opera by Georges Bizet, gets a new and striking modern-dress adaptation in this provocative drama with music. Karmen Gei (Jeinaba Diop Gai) is an inmate in a women's prison in Senegal; lusty, impulsive, and looking out for herself at all times, Karmen's uninhibited dancing and sensual demeanor excites the Sapphic passions of Angelique (Stephanie Biddle), the prison's warden, who allows herself to be seduced by the wanton Karmen. Once Angelique falls asleep, Karmen sees the coast is clear and escapes to town, where she is caught by military policeman Col. Lamine Diop (Magaye Adama Niang) after insulting factotums of the nation's military leadership. However, Diop proves no match for Karmen's seductive charms, and after having her way with him, she once again escapes and Diop finds himself behind bars. Karmen arranges for Diop's escape, but it isn't long before he realizes she is using him as a plaything and has little respect for him as a man; however, by this time he's too deeply addicted to Karmen's passions to turn away. While inspired in part by Bizet's opera, Karmen Gai boats an all-new score by David Murray, Julien Jouga, and Doudou Ndiaye Rose that draws on elements of pop, jazz, and Afro-pop for its original themes.

Longing for an increasingly luxurious way of life, in order to support habits he himself created, Ali is forced to steal and is arrested. When everyone else abandons him, his first wife reveals her loyalty and awaits his release.

Made some 40 years on from his fine Dakar-set 'neo-realist' debut, Borom Saret, Sembène's film features a winning performance from Seye as the titular heroine, one of a breed of successful Senegalese women who have made their way to some kind of fulfilment despite the hangover arrogance, weakness and moral out-datenedness and corruption of her male peers. Using a central Dakar petrol station - which Kiné manages - as a social centre and an example of new Senegalese enterprise, Sembène applies his own version of stylised 'dialectics' to spin a lively, lusty and often funny and illuminating examination of social and economic change in Senegalese society. A marvelous film, offering the psychological insight of Rohmer into its familial story, while contextualising it with a wise, vibrant African optimism all Sembène's own.

Tabataba tells the story of a small Malagasy village during the independence uprising which took place in 1947 in the south of the country. For several months, part of the Malagasy population revolted against the French colonial army in a bloody struggle. The repression in villages that followed was terrible, leading to fires, arrests and torture. Women, children and the elderly were the indirect victims of the conflict and suffered particularly from famine and illness. One leader of the MDRM, the party campaigning for independence, arrives in a village. Solo (François Botozandry), the main character, is still too young to fight but he sees his brother and most of the men in his clan join up. His grandmother, Bakanga (Soavelo), knows what will happen, but Solo still hopes his elder brother will return a hero. After months of rumours, he sees instead the French army arrive to crush the rebellion.

Wend Kuuni (1983)

Gaston Kabore

The mystery of a mute child lies at the center of African filmmaker Gaston Kabore's 1982 film Wend Kuuni (God's Gift), a fable-like drama set amongst the traditional villages of Burkina Faso in the days before industrialization. Discovering the child in an uninhabited area, a traveling peddler takes the young boy to the closest village. Though they do not recognize the boy, a local family chooses to shelter the child while the village chief seeks out the boy's parents. When this search is unsuccessful, the family chooses to adopt the boy, naming him Wend Kuuni -- "God's gift." He soon becomes part of the family, going to work in the fields as a shepherd and becoming friends with a young girl, Pongere. This idyll is disturbed, however, by tensions amongst one of the village families, as the increasingly violent conflict between a woman and her older husband help bring back memories of Wend Kuuni's past, including the tragic story of why he had been forced to leave his home village. Kabore uses his basic, archetypal tale to present an affectionate yet not idealized view of Africa's past and people.

Safrana (Or, The Right To Speak) (1976)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6vhSkk6ZAE&t=3172s
Sidney Sokhona

Like Med Hondo’s SOLEIL O. and Jean Rouch’s PETIT A PETIT, Sidney Sokhona’s SAFRANA (OR, THE RIGHT TO SPEAK) is both a satire of transition after French colonialism and a look at the alienation felt by African migrant communities in nations of their former colonizers. Operating as a reverse ethnography, these films took field notes on European social norms and put their notion of what is standard into question. Alternating between observational comedy and instructional political tract, SAFRANA starts with a quote by Mao about intuitive approaches to figuring out what’s useful for one’s own country in the operations of another, and ends with a documentary on farming techniques for agrarian socialism. A road trip, punctuated by acidic flashback vignettes, gets us from A to B by sketching a former colonizer with less to offer the formerly colonized than vice versa. The film is built around Somankidi Coura, with its ex-factory workers turned farmers playing fictionalized versions of themselves, along with photographer/activist Bouba Touré. With a number of pointed gags, Sokhona charts the various disenchantments of the workers on their exploratory stay in France meant to pick up useful techniques for their home country – from tertiary status at a factory to secondary status in a union; or the casual racism of a couple that won’t let an African garbageman pick up their dog from a trash can to another that wants to bring home a foreigner for kinks. By the time they end up at the farm, we’re as ready for the possible solutions explored in the climax as they are.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlXa-Ug-010 or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plVfsxsG5hc
Jean Dikongue Pipa

This is the story of Betti Betti, Cameroonian singer of the 70s, who ends up sinking into misery. Through his destiny, “Badiaga” is also the sad journey of Cameroonian artists thus revealed, reveals Jean Pierre Dikongue Pipa, its director. The Goethe room was full for the screening of this film released in 1982. From the outset, it appears as a plea for the improvement of the condition of the artist. Beti Beti's difficult childhood and ascension in the music world and misery at the end of the film sound like a lawsuit against the exploitation of musicians by their producers and other show organizers. By a harmonious mixture of sounds, background music and silences, the director brings to life the extent of the exploitation of the singer, illiterate in the film. We also note a recurrence of symbols, both in the gestures and on the body of the main characters. Symbols which also allow Badiaga, the heroine and her brother to recognize each other, even though they had been separated as children. Also to be saluted, the film's true work of memory, which involves stars of the time such as Emile Kangue, Sallé John, Jean Marie Ahanda, or Eko Roosevelt ... in the equally nostalgic setting of clothing fashions, brands of cars, streets of Douala and Yaoundé in the 1980s.

Lumumba, Death of a Prophet (2000)

Raoul Peck

The film is a creative documentary where biography and history, stories and archives create a frame around the figure of Lumumba, his political assassination, media and memory. It is a unique opportunity to examine, 50 years later, the life and legend of Lumumba.[2] The documentary is narrated by the director, Raoul Peck, as he reconstructs a story that interweaves his own personal experiences and the circumstances surrounding the murder of Lumumba. Peck is in Belgium, and uses shots of Brussels to establish his location and contrast with the archival footage he combines to tell Lumumba's story. The film is about absence; absence of a historical figure, absence of clarity about the events surrounding his death, and absence of a true historical construct. Even a true location is absent; he cannot get to Zaire, the topic of his film, but the majority of the archival footage and photos used are from Central Africa. Even if he were able to film in Zaire, he would be faced with an absence, so no matter his location he is still "filming from afar."

This second feature in Nacer Khemir's "Desert Trilogy" is a visually ravishing folktale reminiscent of THE THOUSAND AND ONE NIGHTS. The story revolves around Hassan, who is studying Arabic calligraphy from a grand master. Coming across a fragment of manuscript, Hassan goes in search of the missing pieces, believing that once he finds them, he will learn the secrets of love. With the help of Zin, a lovers' go-between, he meets the beautiful Aziz, Princess of Samarkand. After encountering wars, a battle between false prophets and an ancient curse, he learns that an entire lifetime would not suffice for him to learn the many dimensions of love. Tunisian director Nacer Khemir, also a poet, painter and professional storyteller, notes: "The film takes place in Moslem Andalusia of the 11th century. But it's not a question of reconstituting a given time and place, but rather of summoning up the reflection of a forgotten garden, and out of a yearning for peace, so difficult to protect from barbarians and from destructive fanaticisms. Andalusia has been the meeting place of many cultures, a living dialog of the peoples and religions whose traces can still be deciphered in texts, music and gardens all the way from the Atlantic to the Red Sea. This is not an Andalusian love story, but Andalusia as the very essence of love, through its perfumes, poetry and gardens."

Ousmane Sembène was one of the greatest and most groundbreaking filmmakers who ever lived, as well as the most renowned African director of the twentieth century—and yet his name still deserves to be better known in the rest of the world. He made his feature debut in 1966 with the brilliant and stirring Black Girl. Sembène, who was also an acclaimed novelist in his native Senegal, transforms a deceptively simple plot—about a young Senegalese woman who moves to France to work for a wealthy white family and finds that life in their small apartment becomes a prison, both figuratively and literally—into a complexly layered critique of the lingering colonialist mind-set of a supposedly postcolonial world. Featuring a moving central performance by M’Bissine Thérèse Diop, Black Girl is a harrowing human drama as well as a radical political statement—and one of the essential films of the 1960s.

Alain Gomis	

El Hadj is studying in Paris. He is one of the young Senegalese men who have come to Paris since the French colony became independent to get a good education so that he can serve his fatherland on his return. Unexpectedly he is suddenly confronted by a problem with his residence papers, just because he has arranged an extension too late. His pleasant life filled with good prospects has gone in one fell swoop. He faces a dilemma. He can stay illegally in France, the country where he feels at home, where he has his friends, has fallen in love and can drink water from the tap. Or he can return (without graduating) to the 3rd-world country of Senegal to use the knowledge he has acquired. It is not only a practical choice. It comes down to the question of who he is, who he thought he could be. Gomis' impressive feature début looks at the theme of uprooting both on an existential and emotional level. The everyday confrontation with a different culture makes an apparently simple project difficult and chaotic. Gomis: 'Exile means distancing oneself: abroad you are confronted with yourself. Who are we and which of our thoughts can resist the obtrusiveness of the other world? Probably only that which is really our own essence.'

# Mic'd Bodies

[Robert Altman] tried to replicate natural conversational sounds, even with large casts, by wiring hidden microphones to actors, then recording them talking over each other with multiple soundtracks. During the filming, he wore a headset to ensure that important dialogue could be heard, without emphasizing it. This produced a "dense audio experience" for viewers, allowing them to hear multiple scraps of dialogue, as if they were listening in on various private conversations. Altman recognized that although large casts hurt a film commercially, "I like to see a lot of stuff going on." Altman first used overlapping soundtracks in MASH (1970), a sound technique which movie author Michael Barson describes as "a breathtaking innovation at the time." He developed it, Altman said, to force viewers to pay attention and become engaged in the film as if they were an active participant.

Edward Yang’s That Day, on the Beach (1983) [see 00:15:50] was one of the first New Cinema films to pursuit ‘sonic realism’ in and via  postsynching. Sound lead Duu-Chih Tu first asked female lead Sylvia Chang to dub the subtle sounds of “swallowing saliva, opening the mouth, and breathing” then added room tone/ambience/noise to create “a realistic sense of space” through sound. Tu considered Yang’s subsequent The Terrorizers (1986) to be the high point of postsynching (i.e. sound after filming).

A shift to the use of sync-sound recording (i.e. sound captured during filming) followed, started by Hou Hsiao-Hsien’s A City of Sadness (1989); the first Taiwanese feature film to adopt sync-sound recording (note - in mono). Hou then gave the recording equipment to Tu and his precursor of the 3H Sound Studio - which was used in Yang’s A Brighter Summer Day (1991).

Mani Kaul

A film about the great thumri singer Siddheshwari Devi,who was born on August 8, 1902.  Breaking all conventional modes of biographical or documentary film making, this film becomes a work of transgression. It transgresses both home and dream. Like a sufi wanderer, it celebrates the life of exile.  No spaceholds, no truth encompasses, no identity is the final. Here is afilm that takes the 'documentary' non-representational to its limits, turning the fictional material natural to a biography into a presentation, and the objects and locations into an imaginative becoming of music. Siddheshwari Devi died on March 12, 1966.

Gertie the Dinosaur (1914)

Winsor McCay

Released on September 15th, 1914. Sometimes called the world's oldest cartoon (erroneously), it is still the first to be created using keyframe animation. This movie required Winsor McCay and his assistant John A. Fitzsimmons (who traced the backgrounds) to create 10,000 drawings, which they inked on rice paper and mounted on cardboard. Gertie is a dinosaur based on the Brontosaurus (nowadays known as Apatosaurus) skeleton in the American Museum of Natural History. McCay's employer, William Randolph Hearst, was displeased with McCay's success outside of the newspapers, and used his contractual power to reduce McCay's stage activities.

Lichtspiel Opus I (1921)
https://vimeo.com/262027844
Walter Ruttmann

Walther Ruttmann (1887 – 1941) was initially trained as an architect and painter; he served on the Eastern front during World War I, suffered “shell shock” (what is now known as post traumatic stress disorder), and on being released from the hospital abandoned painting to make films. As he was the son of a wealthy mercantilist, he had the financial means to become a film maker upon being released from the hospital, enabling him to work independently of UFA, the major German studio at the time. His first productions were abstract animated films, and were also the first fully animated cartoon work produced in Germany. Ruttmann’s titles for these works indicate their relationship to the synaesthetic heritage: Lichtspiel: Opus I was produced between 1919 and 1921. It premiered in April 1921, and was released for German theatrical distribution in 1922. It is the oldest fully abstract motion picture known to survive, using only animated geometric forms, arranged and shown without reference to any representational imagery; the first abstract films by Viking Eggeling and Hans Richter were not exhibited publically until 1923.

Fantasia is a 1940 American animated film, produced by Walt Disney Productions and given a wide release by RKO Radio Pictures. The film consists of eight animated segments set to pieces of classical music conducted by Leopold Stokowski; seven of which are performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra. Music critic and composer Deems Taylor acts as the film's Master of Ceremonies, who introduces each segment in live action interstitial scenes. The soundtrack was recorded using multiple audio channels and reproduced with Fantasound, a pioneering sound reproduction system that made Fantasia the first commercial film shown in stereophonic sound.

A "found foliage" film composed of insects, leaves, and other detritus sandwiched between two strips of perforated tape. (note - should have the sound of the film reel perforations -- "tktktktktk" -- emulating the flapping of moth wings at the same time as each frame)

Once A Jolly Swagman (1948)

Medhurst [(2005)](http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/30808/) suggests that in British films of the 1940s and 1960s, there were only visual and verbal clues which would give away a character’s or actor’s “gayness”. These could be a costume, a glance, a sibilant delivery of a line, but would form a viewer’s set of identifiers, both a visual and verbal vocabulary of how to identify themselves in characters on the big screen. For Medhurst, films such as Once a Jolly Swagman (1948), as well as Mr Perrin and Mr Traill (1948), and High Treason (1951) all offer up clues for a spectator who is “in the know”.

Victim (1961)

Basil Dearden

Victim is a 1961 British neo noir suspense film directed by Basil Dearden and starring Dirk Bogarde and Sylvia Syms. It was the first English-language film to use the word "homosexual" and the first commercial film in Britain to deal openly with the need for legal reform concerning homosexuality and was in accord with the recommendations of the Wolfenden Committee, which had examined homosexual offences and prostitution and reported in 1957. The film has attracted much criticism and debate, largely in terms of its liberal prescriptions and its ‘timid’ handling of a controversial theme.

The Servant (1963)

Rarely screened at queer festivals, despite its credentials, The Servant (1963) is based on a short story by Robin Maughan and comes after Bogarde had, two years previously, taken on a genuinely brave role as a homosexual barrister fighting blackmailers in Victim (1961). The BFI says: "Dirk Bogarde gives one of his finest performances as Barrett, a gentleman’s gentleman. This classic tale of master and servant develops into a disturbing psychodrama and the homoerotic sub-text is plain to see. Douglas Slocombe’s brilliant cinematography captures the claustrophobic mood (especially wonderful in its use of mirrors in key scenes) and great performances by Wendy Craig and Sarah Miles."

The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner (1962)

(small rental fee)

This film is an example of the kind of social-realist dramas - also known as kitchen-sink dramas - that found popularity in the late 1950s and 1960s. The genre often dealt with gritty issues affecting Britain at the time and this is no exception. The film follows a young, working-class man who has been sent to a borstal, where he is awarded certain privileges thanks to his talent for cross-country running. As he prepares for an important race against a local public school, he must decide whom he is really running for - himself or the ambitious borstal governor. 

In the The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner (1962), as well as This Sporting Life (Anderson, 1963), If… (Anderson, 1968), and Sunday Bloody Sunday (Schlesinger, 1971), we see male central characters who – Griffiths [(2006)](https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/British_Queer_Cinema.html?id=cHlHa3sQpB8C&redir_esc=y) suggests in his history of Queer Cinema - “find themselves trapped, symbolically reflect[ing] both the experiences of their respective directors, and the general dilemma of being queer in British society at the time”.

Staircase (1969)

In the years after the Sexual Offences Act was passed in Britain, Staircase (Stanley Donen, 1969), featuring Richard Burton and Rex Harrison as a couple of “flaming queen” hairdressers, drew the critical ire of Roger Ebert for its portrayal of Harry and Charlie as a parodic “sideshow attraction”. Ebert comments further that we’re “not asked to watch a movie about homosexuals, but a movie about Harrison and Burton playing homosexuals”.

The same might also be said of Nic Roeg’s Performance (1970) and its gender fluid boundaries that constitute the film’s plot in this subversion of the British gangster genre?
